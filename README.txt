README

These are scripts I used for a research project publcihsed in Global Ecology and Biogeography (https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13504). This work investigated differences/similarities in niches for congeneric plants disjunct between eastern Asia and eastern North America. I've also developed other scripts that I ended up not using here - these will be uploaded to my EcoGeoTools repository soon.
